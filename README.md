# The To-Do App

**The To-Do App** is a responsive task management application built independently during my frontend development studies.  
It was my first individual project and demonstrates my ability to create a clean, functional, and user-friendly web application.

The application allows users to create, manage, prioritize, and track tasks through an intuitive interface.

## Key Features

- Add new tasks  
- Delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Change the order of tasks 
- Persistent data storage using LocalStorage

## Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS / SCSS  
- JavaScript  
- LocalStorage API  

## Purpose of the Project

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of:

- JavaScript fundamentals  
- DOM manipulation  
- State management  
- Application structure and code organization  
- Writing clean and maintainable code  
- Problem-solving and debugging

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped me develop and strengthen several key skills:

- **JavaScript & DOM manipulation:** Learned to dynamically update the interface and handle user interactions.  
- **State management:** Managed tasks' state efficiently and implemented persistent storage using LocalStorage.  
- **Application structure:** Improved my ability to organize code in a maintainable and readable way.  
- **Responsive design:** Designed the interface to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile screens.  
- **Problem-solving & debugging:** Learned to identify and fix bugs independently while improving overall functionality.  
- **UX & usability:** Focused on creating a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.

## Future Improvements
